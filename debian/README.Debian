pyenv-bash for Debian

This package is the shell auto-completion/auto-init side of pyenv. It has been
split off into its own separate package (this is for bash; others will follow)
in order to comply with Debian policy, specifically Section 9.9 of Policy
4.4.1. 

As this package is made for Debian in mind, all modifications are made
'upstream', none are in this package.
